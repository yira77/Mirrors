# Mirrors
An exploration of reflection, symmetry, and quiet play.

This is purely a practice project delving deep into the maths of angles and axes. But after going through it, I was having so much fun and so I decided to turn it into another web-app. Because why not let the world have fun too? And its not that perfect- like I could have added a thousand more features but I loved the simplicity it has now.
# Draw Once. Let the mirror magick work.
Mirrors is an interactive generative drawing tool that reflects your strokes across multiple axes, creating kaleidoscopic patterns in real time. 

- There’s no goal here.
- No right output.
- Just repetition, balance, and movement.

It’s about the quiet satisfaction of seeing a simple action echo back at you
# ✨ Why Mirrors Exists
Mirrors exists because sometimes creativity doesn’t need meaning. Sometimes it just needs structure.

By working within symmetry:
- Your hand relaxes
- Your brain predicts patterns
- Your focus shifts from outcome to process

This project is about enjoying that loop. One stroke becomes many Small changes create big differences Simplicity keeps the experience light.

# Creative Note
Mirrors is meant to feel playful and meditative. Small changes in symmetry or stroke weight can produce dramatically different results. It works best when explored slowly.

# Future Possibilities
There are many things that could be added. But for now, Mirrors feels complete.

# Final Note
Mirrors isn’t about creating something impressive. It’s about creating something quietly satisfying.

If someone loses track of time while using it, then it’s already done its job.

Radhe Radhe! 🌸
